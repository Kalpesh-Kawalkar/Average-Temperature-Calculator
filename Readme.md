## Average Temperature Calculator in Java
In this problem, we have to calculate the average temperature and the no. of days above average temperature for a given no. of days as the input.
### Approach :
I approached this problem via 2 methods :
1. Iterating through the total no. of days without using arrays to store temperatures.
2. Iterating through the total no. of days with the use of an array to store temperatures.
